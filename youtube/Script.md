Research question:
```
What if I mimic the analogy of a real human neural behaviour? E.g if you're put in a room with no dictionary and just a pure wordle solver, no help, only information from your brain. Then it's basically the same as recalling the words and choose it based on your feeling/strategically (which are modeled by hopfield model and information theory type of thing), so I'm planning to implement the system like multiple rounds of recalling the hidden words and ranking them based on the information theory thing?

<=> How might biological memory systems solve strategic language tasks under realistic computational constraints?

- Lock up in a room
  > No looking through anything, only recalling
  > You cannot regex thing out of this, you must use your brain memory retrieval capabilities.

- Choose the most strategic option
  > Information theory: to reason the shit out of the recalled options.


Hopfield Model to retrieve patterns > Apply constraints > Information theory to reason to put the word into place.
